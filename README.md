# Semiconductor Yield Prediction

This project uses machine learning models to predict the pass/fail yield of semiconductor manufacturing processes.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains 1567 rows and 591 features.
- Target variable: `Pass/Fail`

## Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Results

- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.87
- Decision Tree Classifier Accuracy: 0.91

## Instructions

1. Install dependencies using:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the Jupyter notebook to train the model and view the results.
